## Pharmacy Management System

Pharmacy Management System is a software application designed to manage the daily operations of a pharmacy. This project aims to provide a streamlined solution to manage pharmacy operations, including inventory management, prescription tracking, customer management, and billing.

With the Pharmacy Management System, pharmacists and pharmacy staff can easily manage inventory levels of drugs and other medical supplies. The system provides real-time updates on stock levels, enabling pharmacies to order new supplies in a timely manner and avoid stockouts.

The system also tracks prescription orders and ensures they are filled accurately and quickly. This helps to improve the overall efficiency of the pharmacy, reducing wait times for customers and improving customer satisfaction.

The Pharmacy Management System also includes a customer management module that allows pharmacies to maintain a database of customer information, including their medical history and prescription details. This helps pharmacists to provide personalized service to their customers, offering recommendations for over-the-counter medications and advice on managing their health.
